# dungeonAI
stable-diffusion-web-ui extension that generates detailed prompts with ChatGPT

## About
This is in early testing. As of now, you need to manually put your openAI API key into main.py. I'll be adding a button through the UI that takes care of this for you later on. Shoutout to [controlnet](https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet) and [text2prompt](https://github.com/toshiaki1729/stable-diffusion-webui-text2prompt) because I frankensteined your code together to make this.
